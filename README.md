#### Happy to see you there :sunglasses: !

## Instructions

You have to create a simple REST API to allow our team to **perform CRUD operations on Clovis' users**.
These expected operations are specified in the tests.

* Because Clovis backend use [KoaJS](http://koajs.com/) as web framework you must also use it in this exercise.
* You must be able to insert, fetch, update and delete users accounts
* All tests must pass and can't be modified (even the lint !)
* The build and code errors generated by this boilerplate are part of the test.

If you have a problem, start by reading the API and database tests and KoaJS doc. 
If it doesn't help you, ask for help !

## Technical details

* `index.js` and `app.js` files are already coded, you just have to code controllers in `src/controllers.js`
* You should read [koa-router](https://github.com/alexmingoia/koa-router/tree/master) documentation
* You may use [lodash](https://lodash.com/) which is included in the packages.

In this exercise you will use a **really** simple database engine. Allowed methods are :
* find
* findById
* create
* updateById
* removeById

If you want to query nested keys use find like in this example :
```
db.find({
    'address.postalCode': 75000,
})

db.find({
    'hobbies[0].name': 'NodeJS',
})

...
```

You have **1 hour** !
